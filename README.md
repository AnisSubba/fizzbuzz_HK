** FizzBuzz Homework **

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".

* Create a class 'fizzbuzz'
* define 'public static void main'
* import scanner,  so user can enter the limit of number counting,
* Input 'for loop', with if and else statement,
* define if multiplies of number 3 than print fuzz and mulitplies of no 5 than print buzz. 
 
* finished result should output: 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz ... doing this task will give you better understanding of loop and if statement

To have a look at my fizzbuzz java code I have executed, I have uploaded it in 'Anis-fizzbuzz-12fizz4buzz'branch.
